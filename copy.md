## Landing Page (`/`)

### Page Title
Project Record

### Introduction
This is a record of past projects, decisions made under constraints, and lessons learned.

The materials here are available for inspection. They document what was built, how, and why.

### Available Views

**Section heading:** Available Views

**Fit Evaluation**
- Link text: Fit Evaluation
- Description: A short questionnaire that maps role characteristics to documented strengths and gaps.

**Strengths and Gaps**
- Link text: Strengths and Gaps
- Description: An honest breakdown of capabilities and limitations, with links to supporting experiences.

**Experiences**
- Link text: Experiences
- Description: Detailed project records covering context, constraints, decisions, and outcomes.

**Ask**
- Link text: Ask
- Description: A query interface for exploring specific decisions, tradeoffs, or reasoning.

### Fit Outcomes

**Section heading:** Fit Outcomes

- **Not a Fit** — Clear misalignment. The fit evaluation explains why.
- **Strong Fit** — Good alignment with documented strengths.
- **Partial Fit** — Some alignment, with specific concerns noted.

## Experiences Page (`/experiences`)

### Page Title
Experience Explorer

### What This Tells You
Each experience documents real context, constraints, decisions, and lessons learned. This shows how I work under pressure, what I prioritize, and how I reflect on outcomes.

### How to Choose
You do not need to read all experiences. Pick 1–2 that are relevant to your context:

- For **team collaboration**: University Software Engineering Group Project
- For **professional work**: First Professional Web Development Role
- For **scope control**: PoEBoss Companion App or Academic Prioritization
- For **early execution patterns**: Bug Tracker or Mutudu Todo App

If the fit evaluation already gave you a clear answer, reading experiences may not be necessary.

## Strengths and Gaps Page (`/strengths`)

### Page Title
Strengths and Gaps

### What This Tells You
This is an honest assessment of where I can contribute and where I cannot. Each strength links to experiences that demonstrate it. Gaps are stated plainly without hedging.

### How to Use This
Compare these against your role requirements:

- **Strong** items indicate reliable contribution areas
- **Developing** items show growth potential with guidance
- **Not my strength yet** items are gaps that may disqualify the fit

If a gap matches a critical requirement for your role, this is likely not a fit. If strengths align with your needs and gaps are acceptable, proceed to the fit evaluation.

### Category Labels
- Strong
- Developing
- Not my strength yet

### Strength Items

**Strong:**
- **Judgment under constraints** — Making practical decisions when time, resources, or information are limited.
- **Scope control** — Reducing ambition to match reality rather than over-promising.
- **Learning through iteration** — Improving by shipping small increments and responding to feedback.
- **High execution capacity** — Ability to build and ship functional systems independently.
- **Willingness to adapt process** — Changing how I work when evidence shows current approach is failing.
- **Honest reflection on failure modes** — Identifying and admitting when my approach caused problems.
- **Willingness to abandon work** — Stopping projects based on cost-benefit assessment rather than sunk-cost pressure.

**Developing:**
- **Early architecture clarity** — Defining clear structure upfront before implementation begins.
- **Demand validation** — Checking whether work will be used or valued before building.

**Not my strength yet:**
- **Experience with large-scale systems** — I have not worked on systems with high traffic or distributed architectures.
- **Long-term ownership narratives** — I have not yet maintained a system over multiple years.

## Fit Evaluation Page (`/fit-evaluation`)

### Page Title
Fit Evaluation

### What This Tells You
This tool provides a deterministic fit assessment based on role characteristics. It is grounded in my documented strengths and gaps. The goal is to save time for both sides by identifying mismatches early.

### When to Trust the Result
- **"Not a Fit"** — Stop here. Further exploration is unlikely to change this.
- **"Strong Fit"** — Proceed with confidence. Explore further only if you have specific concerns.
- **"Partial Fit"** — Review the concerns listed. Check strengths/gaps or specific experiences if concerns are critical to your decision.

### Form Labels

**Role Type:**
- Individual Contributor
- Tech Lead
- Manager

**Team Size:**
- Small (2-5 people)
- Medium (6-15 people)
- Large (15+ people)

**Domain Familiarity:**
- Familiar domain
- Adjacent domain
- Completely new domain

**Autonomy Level:**
- High autonomy expected
- Moderate guidance available
- Structured onboarding provided

**Submit button:** Evaluate Fit

### Fit Result Labels

- Partial Fit
- Not a Fit

### Result Section Headings

### Fit Evaluation Responses

**Strong Fit Summary:**
This role appears to be a good alignment with my current capabilities.

**Strong Fit Recommendation:**
I would be interested in exploring this opportunity further.

**Partial Fit Summary:**
This role has some alignment, but there are areas that may require additional support or time.

**Partial Fit Recommendation:**
If the concerns listed are acceptable trade-offs, a conversation may still be worthwhile.

**Not a Fit Summary:**
This role has significant gaps relative to my current capabilities. Proceeding would likely waste time for both sides.

**Not a Fit Recommendation:**
I recommend not proceeding. This is not a criticism of the role—it is an honest assessment that we would both be better served by other matches.

### Alignment/Concern Statements

**Strengths (alignment points):**
- Individual contributor roles align with my current experience level
- Small teams match my experience with close collaboration
- Medium teams are workable with clear communication structures
- Familiar domains reduce ramp-up time
- Adjacent domains are learnable with demonstrated learning velocity
- Structured onboarding supports successful integration
- Moderate guidance matches my iterative working style

**Concerns:**
- Limited experience leading technical direction for a team
- No management experience - this is explicitly not my strength yet
- No experience with large-scale team coordination
- Completely new domains require more onboarding investment
- High autonomy from day one may be challenging without domain context

### Partial Fit Note
This result is partial. If concerns are critical, check Strengths and Gaps or specific experiences for more context.

## Ask Page (`/ask`)

### Page Title
Ask About How I Work

### What This Tells You
This interface answers questions about my experiences, decisions, strengths, and gaps. All responses are grounded in documented data—no generated claims, no speculation.

### What You Can Ask
- Questions about specific experiences (e.g., "Tell me about the university project")
- Questions about decisions and tradeoffs (e.g., "Why did you scope down?")
- Questions about strengths and gaps (e.g., "What are your weaknesses?")
- Questions about fit for a role type (e.g., "Would you fit a management role?")

### What It Cannot Answer
- Questions outside documented experiences
- Speculative or hypothetical scenarios
- Topics unrelated to professional capability

If you get an "out of scope" response, try the Fit Evaluation or browse Experiences directly.

### Form Elements
