## Project Overview

This is a **Capability Discovery Interface** - a candidate-controlled landing page that enables employers to evaluate reasoning, learning, and fit through investigation rather than filtering. It is not a resume; it is a conversion surface for after attention is earned.

## Key Documents

- **prd.json** - Authoritative source for requirements and acceptance criteria
- **INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Supplementary context for Claude Code sessions
- **workplan.md** - Implementation strategy and design principles
- **experience_reference.md** - Canonical source for AI grounding context
