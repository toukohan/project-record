## Experience 1: University Software Engineering Group Project

### Context
University Software Engineering course group project with an imaginary client.
Team members had varied technical capabilities.
Total available time was ~6 hours per week per person.

### Constraints
- Tight time budget
- Uneven skill distribution in the team
- Client preference for a web application
- Risk of over-scoping relative to team capability

### Initial Tension
I wanted to build a web application and tested whether I could prototype one quickly.
I realized this direction would:
- Increase delivery risk
- Create dependency on me
- Serve my personal interest more than team success

### Decision
I intentionally reduced the project scope and technical ambition:
- Chose an approach aligned with team capability
- Focused on completing sprint stories reliably
- Prioritized delivery and responsiveness over technical novelty

### Outcome
- Project completed on time
- Sprint goals met
- Changes implemented based on client feedback
- Group received close to maximum points

### What Worked
- Ego management
- Scope control
- Alignment with team reality
- Incremental delivery

### What Didn’t
- Early architecture was unclear
- Initial phase felt scattered
- Team members waited on each other unnecessarily

### What I’d Do Differently
- Establish a clearer architecture upfront
- Define ownership boundaries earlier
- Reduce early ambiguity for the team

### Signals This Experience Demonstrates
- Judgment under constraints
- Team-oriented decision-making
- Delivery focus
- Willingness to sacrifice personal preference for outcome

## Experience 2: First Professional Web Development Role (Local Company)

### Context
Worked as a web developer improving an existing e-commerce site.
This was my first role as a programmer.
The site was based on WordPress and custom theming.

### Constraints
- No prior professional programming experience
- Learning while delivering
- Real business expectations
- Limited feedback structure initially

### Initial Failure Mode
I believed:
- Work needed to be close to perfect before showing progress
This resulted in:
- Slow progress
- Unclear priorities
- Frustration for both sides

### Decision
Shifted working model to:
- Iterative development
- Frequent check-ins
- Explicit prioritization based on employer feedback

### Outcome
- Clearer direction for development
- Tangible progress on the WordPress theme
- Reduced anxiety and better alignment

### What Worked
- Feedback loops
- Breaking work into smaller increments
- Aligning effort with business priorities

### What Didn’t
- Initial perfectionism
- Over-optimizing before validation

### What I’d Do Differently
- Start iterative work immediately
- Surface work-in-progress early
- Ask clarifying questions sooner

### Signals This Experience Demonstrates
- Learning velocity
- Process correction
- Comfort with feedback
- Ability to function in real-world ambiguity

## Experience 3: Academic Workload Prioritization

### Context
A period with an overloaded university course schedule.

### Constraints
- Limited time
- Multiple simultaneous demands
- Optional vs mandatory assignments

### Decision
Dropped an optional assignment in one course after evaluating:
- Credit impact
- Time cost
- Overall workload balance

### Outcome
- All courses completed
- Mostly strong grades
- Reduced stress and better focus

### What Worked
- Strategic prioritization
- Willingness to drop non-critical work

### What I’d Do Differently
- Assess priorities earlier
- Re-evaluate commitments sooner

### Signals This Experience Demonstrates
- Resource allocation
- Self-regulation
- Outcome-oriented thinking
