Sprint started.
No features implemented yet.

- package.json with dev, build, test scripts
- Vitest configured for testing with jsdom environment
- Minimal App component with placeholder content
- README documenting all commands

Verified:
- npm install succeeds
- npm run dev starts server on localhost:5173

## TEST-001: Test harness with CI ✓

Implemented:
- GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Runs on push to main and pull requests
- Executes: npm ci, npm run build, npm test

Verified:
- npm test passes locally
- Tests correctly fail when assertion is broken (exit code 1)
- CI workflow configured for GitHub Actions

## UI-001: Landing page with evaluation-focused framing ✓

Implemented:
- Updated App.tsx with positioning statement from workplan.md
- Content frames the site as evaluation surface, not resume
- No claims, only investigation-oriented language
- Added test verifying positioning statement is present

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (2 tests)
- Content avoids resume-style claims

## UI-002: Exploration paths on landing page ✓

Implemented:
- Added react-router-dom for client-side routing
- Created src/pages/ directory with Landing, Ask, Fit components
- Landing page CTAs: "Ask about how I work" → /ask, "Check fit for your role" → /fit
- Placeholder content on /ask and /fit routes
- Tests for all routes (5 tests total)

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (5 tests)
- Routes render without errors

## EXP-001: Canonical experience data model ✓

Implemented:
- Created src/data/experiences.ts with TypeScript interfaces
- Experience interface captures: context, constraints, decisions, outcomes, lessonsLearned, signals
- All three experiences from experience_reference.md represented
- Documented with JSDoc comments explaining structure and extensibility
- Added getExperienceById helper function
- Created comprehensive test suite (6 tests)

Verified:
- npx tsc --noEmit passes
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (11 tests total)
- Breaking model shape causes typecheck and tests to fail

## EXP-002: Experience Explorer UI ✓

Implemented:
- Created src/pages/Experiences.tsx with list and detail views
- Route /experiences shows all experiences as links
- Route /experiences/:id shows full experience detail
- Detail view displays: context, constraints, decisions, outcomes, lessons learned, signals
- Client-side navigation between experiences
- No AI-generated content, purely deterministic rendering from data model
- Added 3 tests for experience explorer (list, detail, not found)

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (14 tests total)
- Existing routes unaffected

## EXP-003: Strengths and gaps matrix ✓

Implemented:
- Created src/data/strengths.ts with StrengthItem interface
- Three categories: Strong, Developing, Not my strength yet
- Each item links to evidence from canonical experiences via evidenceIds
- Plain language descriptions without buzzwords
- Gaps stated explicitly without hedging (e.g., "I have not worked on...")
- Created src/pages/Strengths.tsx with route /strengths
- Added 6 data model tests and 3 UI tests

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (23 tests total)
- Evidence IDs reference valid experiences (validated by test)
- Breaking experience IDs causes tests to fail

## FIT-001: Manual fit evaluation tool ✓

Implemented:
- Created src/data/fitEvaluation.ts with deterministic fit logic
- Structured inputs: roleType, teamSize, domainFamiliarity, autonomyLevel
- Three outcomes: Strong Fit, Partial Fit, Not a Fit
- Each result includes strengths, concerns, summary, and recommendation
- "Not a Fit" explicitly advises against proceeding
- Created src/pages/FitEvaluation.tsx with route /fit-evaluation
- Form with radio buttons (no free-text)
- Added 6 logic tests and 3 UI tests

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (32 tests total)
- Identical inputs produce identical results (deterministic)
- Language emphasizes mutual time-saving

## AI-001: Grounded AI query interface ✓

Clarification received: Option B - deterministic rule-based query interface.

Implemented:
- Created src/data/queryEngine.ts with processQuery() function
- Intent detection via pattern matching (greeting, experience, strength, gap, decision, lesson, context, fit, out-of-scope)
- Handlers return grounded responses from canonical experience and strength data
- Explicit out-of-scope refusal for questions outside grounding context
- Multi-turn conversation support (history parameter)
- Follow-up suggestions in responses
- Upgraded /ask route to use query engine
- Conversation UI with clear, sources, and suggestions
- Created comprehensive test suite (13 query engine tests)

Key design decisions:
- Intent detection checks specific intents (decision, lesson, fit) before general ones (experience) to avoid false matches
- All responses reference canonical data sources
- No AI API, no backend, no secrets - fully static and deterministic
- Pattern matching uses regex for flexibility

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (52 tests total)
- Identical inputs produce identical outputs (deterministic)
- Out-of-scope questions are refused appropriately
- Responses match canonical data

## EXP-004: Experience data synchronization ✓

Implemented:
- Updated src/data/experiences.ts with all 7 experiences from experience_reference.md
- Added 4 new experiences: bug-tracker-workforce-training, mutudu-todo-app, javafx-time-management, poeboss-companion-app
- Updated src/data/strengths.ts with new evidence links and 2 new strength items
- Added "High execution capacity" and "Willingness to abandon work" as strengths
- Added "Demand validation" as a developing area
- Updated src/data/queryEngine.ts intent detection to handle new experiences
- Extended pattern matching for experience-specific queries
- Fixed intent detection ordering to handle "time management" without triggering fit logic
- Updated out-of-scope message to dynamically reference experience count
- Added 6 new tests validating new experiences and queries

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (58 tests total)
- All experience IDs are stable
- Query engine responds correctly to queries about all 7 experiences
- Strengths evidence links reference valid experience IDs

## UX-001: Guided evaluation flow ✓

Implemented:
- Updated Landing page with recommended evaluation path (2–5 minutes estimate)
- Added numbered steps: Fit Evaluation → Strengths → Experiences → Ask
- Added "When to Stop" guidance explaining when fit result is sufficient
- Updated Experiences page with "What This Tells You" and "How to Choose" sections
- Added guidance on selecting 1–2 relevant experiences rather than reading all
- Updated Strengths page with decision-influence explanation
- Explained how to compare strengths/gaps against role requirements
- Updated FitEvaluation page with "When to Trust the Result" guidance
- Explained when each fit level (Strong/Partial/Not a Fit) should end exploration
- Updated Ask page with "What You Can Ask" and "What It Cannot Answer" sections
- Added cross-links between sections with directional guidance
- Updated Fit.tsx to redirect to /fit-evaluation
- All language remains neutral, factual, non-promotional
- No new business logic, data models, or AI behavior introduced

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (61 tests total)
- All orientation copy is covered by UI tests
- Existing functionality unchanged

## DEPLOY-001: Public deployment ✓

Implemented:
- Created .github/workflows/deploy.yml for GitHub Pages deployment
- Configured vite.config.ts with dynamic base path for GitHub Pages
- Added basename to BrowserRouter for correct SPA routing
- Deploy workflow creates 404.html for SPA routing (handles direct URL access)
- Deploy workflow runs tests before deploying (deployment blocked if tests fail)
- Updated README with deployment URL and usage instructions

Deployed to: https://toukohan.github.io/how-i-work/

Verified:
- Site is live and accessible
- All routes render correctly
- CI pipeline passes
