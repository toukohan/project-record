Sprint started.
No features implemented yet.

## ENV-001: Reproducible development environment ✓

Implemented:
- Vite + React + TypeScript project structure
- package.json with dev, build, test scripts
- Vitest configured for testing with jsdom environment
- Minimal App component with placeholder content
- README documenting all commands

Verified:
- npm install succeeds
- npm run dev starts server on localhost:5173
- npm run build produces dist/ output
- npm test passes (1 test)

## TEST-001: Test harness with CI ✓

Implemented:
- GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Runs on push to main and pull requests
- Executes: npm ci, npm run build, npm test

Verified:
- npm test passes locally
- Tests correctly fail when assertion is broken (exit code 1)
- CI workflow configured for GitHub Actions

## UI-001: Landing page with evaluation-focused framing ✓

Implemented:
- Updated App.tsx with positioning statement from workplan.md
- Content frames the site as evaluation surface, not resume
- No claims, only investigation-oriented language
- Added test verifying positioning statement is present

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (2 tests)
- Content avoids resume-style claims

## UI-002: Exploration paths on landing page ✓

Implemented:
- Added react-router-dom for client-side routing
- Created src/pages/ directory with Landing, Ask, Fit components
- Landing page CTAs: "Ask about how I work" → /ask, "Check fit for your role" → /fit
- Placeholder content on /ask and /fit routes
- Tests for all routes (5 tests total)

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (5 tests)
- Routes render without errors

## EXP-001: Canonical experience data model ✓

Implemented:
- Created src/data/experiences.ts with TypeScript interfaces
- Experience interface captures: context, constraints, decisions, outcomes, lessonsLearned, signals
- All three experiences from experience_reference.md represented
- Documented with JSDoc comments explaining structure and extensibility
- Added getExperienceById helper function
- Created comprehensive test suite (6 tests)

Verified:
- npx tsc --noEmit passes
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (11 tests total)
- Breaking model shape causes typecheck and tests to fail

## EXP-002: Experience Explorer UI ✓

Implemented:
- Created src/pages/Experiences.tsx with list and detail views
- Route /experiences shows all experiences as links
- Route /experiences/:id shows full experience detail
- Detail view displays: context, constraints, decisions, outcomes, lessons learned, signals
- Client-side navigation between experiences
- No AI-generated content, purely deterministic rendering from data model
- Added 3 tests for experience explorer (list, detail, not found)

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (14 tests total)
- Existing routes unaffected

## EXP-003: Strengths and gaps matrix ✓

Implemented:
- Created src/data/strengths.ts with StrengthItem interface
- Three categories: Strong, Developing, Not my strength yet
- Each item links to evidence from canonical experiences via evidenceIds
- Plain language descriptions without buzzwords
- Gaps stated explicitly without hedging (e.g., "I have not worked on...")
- Created src/pages/Strengths.tsx with route /strengths
- Added 6 data model tests and 3 UI tests

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (23 tests total)
- Evidence IDs reference valid experiences (validated by test)
- Breaking experience IDs causes tests to fail

## FIT-001: Manual fit evaluation tool ✓

Implemented:
- Created src/data/fitEvaluation.ts with deterministic fit logic
- Structured inputs: roleType, teamSize, domainFamiliarity, autonomyLevel
- Three outcomes: Strong Fit, Partial Fit, Not a Fit
- Each result includes strengths, concerns, summary, and recommendation
- "Not a Fit" explicitly advises against proceeding
- Created src/pages/FitEvaluation.tsx with route /fit-evaluation
- Form with radio buttons (no free-text)
- Added 6 logic tests and 3 UI tests

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (32 tests total)
- Identical inputs produce identical results (deterministic)
- Language emphasizes mutual time-saving

## AI-001: Grounded AI query interface - BLOCKED

Blocking Ambiguity:
This requirement asks for an "AI-powered query interface" but does not specify:
1. Which AI provider to use (OpenAI, Anthropic, local model, etc.)
2. How API keys should be managed (environment variables, secrets service)
3. Whether a backend is required or if this should use client-side AI
4. Cost/budget constraints for API calls
5. Whether a mock/simulated AI is acceptable for MVP

The guiding principles state "static-first, extend later" but an AI interface
requires external API calls, which is not static.

Options requiring clarification:
A) Use a real AI API (requires provider choice, API key setup, possible backend)
B) Create a simulated rule-based interface that mimics AI behavior
C) Defer this feature to a later phase

Requesting direction before proceeding.

## Sprint Status

7 of 8 PRD requirements pass.
1 requirement (ai-001) blocked pending clarification.
