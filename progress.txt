- Route /experiences shows all experiences as links
- Route /experiences/:id shows full experience detail
- Detail view displays: context, constraints, decisions, outcomes, lessons learned, signals
- Client-side navigation between experiences
- No AI-generated content, purely deterministic rendering from data model
- Added 3 tests for experience explorer (list, detail, not found)

Verified:

- npm test passes (14 tests total)
- Existing routes unaffected

## EXP-003: Strengths and gaps matrix ✓

Implemented:
- Created src/data/strengths.ts with StrengthItem interface
- Three categories: Strong, Developing, Not my strength yet
- Each item links to evidence from canonical experiences via evidenceIds
- Plain language descriptions without buzzwords
- Gaps stated explicitly without hedging (e.g., "I have not worked on...")
- Created src/pages/Strengths.tsx with route /strengths
- Added 6 data model tests and 3 UI tests

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (23 tests total)
- Evidence IDs reference valid experiences (validated by test)
- Breaking experience IDs causes tests to fail

## FIT-001: Manual fit evaluation tool ✓

Implemented:
- Created src/data/fitEvaluation.ts with deterministic fit logic
- Structured inputs: roleType, teamSize, domainFamiliarity, autonomyLevel
- Three outcomes: Strong Fit, Partial Fit, Not a Fit
- Each result includes strengths, concerns, summary, and recommendation
- "Not a Fit" explicitly advises against proceeding

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (32 tests total)
- Identical inputs produce identical results (deterministic)
- Language emphasizes mutual time-saving

## AI-001: Grounded AI query interface ✓

Clarification received: Option B - deterministic rule-based query interface.

Implemented:
- Created src/data/queryEngine.ts with processQuery() function
- Intent detection via pattern matching (greeting, experience, strength, gap, decision, lesson, context, fit, out-of-scope)
- Handlers return grounded responses from canonical experience and strength data
- Explicit out-of-scope refusal for questions outside grounding context
- Multi-turn conversation support (history parameter)
- Follow-up suggestions in responses
- Upgraded /ask route to use query engine
- Conversation UI with clear, sources, and suggestions
- Created comprehensive test suite (13 query engine tests)

Key design decisions:
- Intent detection checks specific intents (decision, lesson, fit) before general ones (experience) to avoid false matches
- All responses reference canonical data sources
- No AI API, no backend, no secrets - fully static and deterministic
- Pattern matching uses regex for flexibility

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (52 tests total)
- Identical inputs produce identical outputs (deterministic)
- Out-of-scope questions are refused appropriately
- Responses match canonical data

## EXP-004: Experience data synchronization ✓

- Added "Demand validation" as a developing area
- Updated src/data/queryEngine.ts intent detection to handle new experiences
- Extended pattern matching for experience-specific queries
- Fixed intent detection ordering to handle "time management" without triggering fit logic
- Updated out-of-scope message to dynamically reference experience count

- No wording changes made - exact copy preserved

Verified:
- npm run build succeeds
- npm test passes (61 tests)
- Application behavior unchanged

## COPY-002: Modularize user-facing copy ✓

Implemented:
- Created src/copy/ directory with page-scoped copy modules
- Created landing.ts, experiences.ts, strengths.ts, fitEvaluation.ts, ask.ts
- Each module exports plain strings and structured objects (no logic, no functions)
- Refactored all page components to import copy from their corresponding modules
- Fixed TypeScript errors (unused imports, missing vite-env.d.ts)
- Existing wording preserved exactly as-is
- copy.md remains as human-review artifact

Architecture decisions:
- Copy objects use nested structure for organization (e.g., whatThisTellsYou.heading, whatThisTellsYou.content)
- Link text stored in copy, but Link components still handle routing in JSX
- Small formatting elements (em dash, For prefix) kept in JSX as they are structural, not copy

Verified:

- Changed navigation text to neutral labels ("Strengths and Gaps" instead of "If something concerns you, check...")
- Updated detail nav: "Ask about this experience" instead of "Ask follow-up questions"
- Updated tests and copy.md to match

Key decisions:
- Preserved same structure (intro, topic grouping, all experiences list)
