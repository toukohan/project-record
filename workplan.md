# Workplan: Capability Discovery Interface (Personal Hiring Surface)

## Purpose
Create a candidate-controlled interface that allows employers to:
- Discover how I think
- Evaluate how I learn and adapt
- Assess fit honestly and early
- Engage in investigation mode instead of filtering mode

This is not a resume replacement.
This is a conversion surface once attention is earned.

---

## Core Positioning

### What This Interface Is
- A tool to explore reasoning, judgment, and growth
- A way to demonstrate capability through interaction
- A bidirectional fit assessment

### What This Interface Is NOT
- A seniority flex
- A list of claims
- A keyword-optimized artifact
- A substitute for substance

---

## Primary Value Proposition

> “This interface helps you decide whether I can safely contribute to your team,
> learn your domain, and deliver under real constraints.”

---

## Target Audience (Initial)
Best fit for:
- Small to mid-sized teams
- Early-stage or pragmatic startups
- Technical founders
- Hiring managers tired of resume noise

Not optimized for:
- Traditional HR-first pipelines
- Credential-heavy screening environments

---

## Design Principles

1. **Show thinking, not authority**
2. **Demonstrate learning, not perfection**
3. **Publish constraints and gaps**
4. **Replace claims with interrogable context**
5. **Save employer time by saying “not a fit” when appropriate**

---

## MVP Scope (Phase 1)

### 1. Landing Page
Minimal framing:
- Name
- Role framing (e.g. “Software Engineer focused on learning fast and delivering reliably”)
- Statement of purpose

Primary CTAs:
- “Ask about how I work”
- “Check fit for your role”

---

### 2. AI Query Interface (Core)
Purpose:
- Allow employers to interrogate experience
- Surface reasoning, tradeoffs, and reflection

AI Grounding:
- `experience_reference.md`
- Project artifacts (where available)
- Explicit instruction to:
  - Be honest about gaps
  - Prefer explanation over assertion

---

### 3. Experience Explorer
Each experience presented as:
- Short summary
- Expandable “AI Context”:
  - Constraints
  - Decisions
  - Tradeoffs
  - Outcomes
  - Lessons learned

No marketing language.
Clarity over polish.

---

### 4. Strengths & Gaps Matrix
Explicit categories:
- Strong
- Developing
- Not my strength (yet)

Purpose:
- Signal self-awareness
- Reduce mismatched conversations
- Increase trust

---

### 5. Fit Assessment Tool (Adapted)

Input:
- Job description pasted by employer

Output:
- Honest assessment:
  - Where I fit well (with evidence)
  - Where I partially fit
  - Where I do not fit

Tone:
- Collaborative, not salesy

Key signal:
> “I am evaluating fit too.”

---

### 6. Evidence Layer
Linked where relevant:
- Repos
- Course projects
- Writeups
- Architecture sketches (even informal)

Incomplete artifacts are acceptable if explained.

---

### 7. Next Actions
Low-pressure options:
- Request conversation
- Ask deeper technical questions
- Download short summary

No funnels. No urgency language.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Manual + Honest
- Static site
- One AI model
- Limited scope
- Focus on coherence

Goal:
> Validate that this framing resonates before automation.

---

### Phase 2: Refinement
- Improve AI grounding
- Add structured prompts
- Track what employers ask

---

### Phase 3: Expansion (Optional)
- More projects
- Deeper technical artifacts
- More nuanced fit logic

Only expand what gets used.

---

## Success Criteria

Qualitative:
- Employers engage for minutes, not seconds
- Questions go deeper faster
- Fewer but higher-quality conversations

Quantitative:
- Higher response rate when shared
- Reduced wasted interviews

---

## Strategic Outcome

Instead of:
- Competing in a pile
- Optimizing for filters
- Compressing yourself into bullets

You:
- Control the interaction
- Invite investigation
- Compete on clarity and substance

---

## Guiding Question
> “What can someone discover about how I work that no resume could show?”

Everything in this project must answer that.
